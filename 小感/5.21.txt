   There must be something wrong. I also really want a sister. A cute, smart and sunny sister,just samilar with me.I don't want anything,but the true happiness. Don't like competetion,boring aim, ridiculous judge. However,utill now I can't handle all of these things. I can't be confident to do the thing I believe right,because even the policy is groudless,but I can't control it to stand the top. More importantly, I see some limit parts of myslfe, so I can't totally say I am right,follow my heart is right. It's a sad thing. So,the one who can really save me is myself.I must to do more thing I can do,to experirnce more,to undergo more,to live my life with suffer and happiness.The sunshine I got in the last twenty years can suport me go ahead.
